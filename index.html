              <!--change time-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Physics, Lehigh University. Before enrolling in Lehigh, I hold B.S. from Special Class for the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China. (Read my brief <a href="cv.html">CV</a>)</p>
            <!--<p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm actively seeking opportunities in the fields of: Quantitative financial modeling, Data Science and Software developing. Please find my CV <a href="cv.html">here</a>.</p>-->
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My current research is computational biophysics. Professor <a href="http://athena.physics.lehigh.edu/">Dimitrios Vavylonis</a> advices me on my thesis. The research project focuses on building computational models to describe the complex structure and dynamics of actin network within different cell systems. Starting from simple physical properties of actin-binding proteins, we were able to build up a 3D model that qualitatively and quantitatively resembled the structures of the actin cables in fission yeast, budding yeast and spherical confinement. Previous research projects include:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Worm-like chain (WLC) and Semiflexible polymers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Lennard-Jones particles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Image registration and shape finding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Quantum information and computation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Remote Methane Leak Detector<br>
Detailed description and visualizations can be found <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long terms of scientific training equipped me with strong mathematical and coding skills. I'm familiar with developing in C++, Java and Python as well as modeling in MatLab and Mathematica. At the same time, I have a strong interest in financial market.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm also a avid photographer (<a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a>) and cyclist.</p>

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My research projects are described in
              detail <a href="projects.html">here</a> with videos and figures.
              Projects:&nbsp;</p>
            <p>1.<em>Actin cable dynamics</em>: This is the main research topic
              towards my PhD thesis. Actin is a protein ubiquitous in living
              cells. Actin monomers can link to form actin filaments (F-actin).
              These actin filaments can be bundled together by cross-linking
              proteins to form actin cables. Here I developed a very
              comprehensive yet complicated 3D model which includes various
              protein mechanism to describe the dynamics of actin cables.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>2.<em>Actin dynamics in droplet</em>: Vast amount of research is
              focused upon the dynamics of actin <span style="font-style: italic;">in
                vitro</span>. Here I studied the actin dynamics in a confined
              droplet.</p>
            <p>3.<em>Worm-like chain (WLC) and Semiflexible polymers</em>: WLCs
              are found anywhere in our daily life. They can be as tiny as
              double-stranded DNA chain which is about 70nm in length (10<sup>-8</sup>m)
              to as large as polymeric materials that can span hundreds of
              meters (10<sup>3</sup>m). I developed a semiflexible polymer model
              that reflects the WLC behavior and simulated it in Java. I studied
              its mechanical properties and compared persistence lengths during
              the process of "zipping" and bundled phases. </p>
            <p>4.<em>Lennard-Jones particles</em>: I simulated a system of
              particles under Lennard-Jones potentials using both molecular
              dynamics and Monte Carlo algorithm. Constraint conditions were
              applied to simulate the Lennard-Jones dumbbell systems.</p>
            <p>5.<em>Image registration and shape finding</em>: 3D image
              structures can be generated from stacking 2D image slices. By
              applying a Gaussian filter and thresholding method it is possible
              to get rid of some background noise. Then I used region growing to
              find the shape of the image. I developed a specific shape find
              method that detects and marks the filamentous shape and was able
              to extract the skeleton of the shapes and find the mechanical
              properties accordingly.</p>

            <p>7.<em>Remote Methane Leak Detector</em>.</p>
