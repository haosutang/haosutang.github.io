              <!--change time-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently a S.M.
              student in the Computational Science and Engineering program,
              Harvard University. Before being enrolled in Harvard, I obtained
              Ph.D. degree from department of Physics, Lehigh University. I hold
              B.S. from Special Class for the Gifted Young at University of
              Science and Technology of China.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm interested in doing quantitative
              finance and data science.</p>
            <!--<p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm actively seeking opportunities in the fields of: Quantitative financial modeling, Data Science and Software developing. Please find my CV <a href="cv.html">here</a>.</p>-->
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My past research is computational
              molecular cell biology from a physics point of view. Professor <a
                 href="http://athena.physics.lehigh.edu/">Dimitrios
                Vavylonis</a> adviced me on my thesis. The research project
              focuses on building computational models to describe the complex
              structure and dynamics of actin network within different cell
              systems. Starting from simple physical properties of actin-binding
              proteins, we were able to build up a 3D model that qualitatively
              and quantitatively resembled the structures of the actin cables in
              fission yeast, budding yeast and spherical confinement.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long terms of scientific training
              equipped me with strong mathematical and coding skills. I'm
              familiar with developing in Python, Java and C++ as well as
              modeling in R, MatLab and Mathematica. I'm especially interested
              in integration and application of these mathematical and
              computational tools to solve real world problems, such as
              quantitative finance, data science and computational biology.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm also a avid photographer (<a  href="gallery.html">Gallery</a>)
              and cyclist.</p>

            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My research projects are described in              detail <a href="projects.html">here</a> with videos and figures.
              Projects:&nbsp;</p>            <p>1.<em>Actin cable dynamics</em>: This is the main research topic
              towards my PhD thesis. Actin is a protein ubiquitous in living              cells. Actin monomers can link to form actin filaments (F-actin).
              These actin filaments can be bundled together by cross-linking              proteins to form actin cables. Here I developed a very
              comprehensive yet complicated 3D model which includes various              protein mechanism to describe the dynamics of actin cables.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>2.<em>Actin dynamics in droplet</em>: Vast amount of research is              focused upon the dynamics of actin <span style="font-style: italic;">in
                vitro</span>. Here I studied the actin dynamics in a confined              droplet.</p>
            <p>3.<em>Worm-like chain (WLC) and Semiflexible polymers</em>: WLCs              are found anywhere in our daily life. They can be as tiny as
              double-stranded DNA chain which is about 70nm in length (10<sup>-8</sup>m)              to as large as polymeric materials that can span hundreds of
              meters (10<sup>3</sup>m). I developed a semiflexible polymer model              that reflects the WLC behavior and simulated it in Java. I studied
              its mechanical properties and compared persistence lengths during              the process of "zipping" and bundled phases. </p>
            <p>4.<em>Lennard-Jones particles</em>: I simulated a system of              particles under Lennard-Jones potentials using both molecular
              dynamics and Monte Carlo algorithm. Constraint conditions were              applied to simulate the Lennard-Jones dumbbell systems.</p>
            <p>5.<em>Image registration and shape finding</em>: 3D image              structures can be generated from stacking 2D image slices. By
              applying a Gaussian filter and thresholding method it is possible              to get rid of some background noise. Then I used region growing to
              find the shape of the image. I developed a specific shape find              method that detects and marks the filamentous shape and was able
              to extract the skeleton of the shapes and find the mechanical              properties accordingly.</p>
