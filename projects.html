Model of actin dynamics in fission yeast</h3>            <p>(This is my PhD thesis work advised by Professor <a  href="http://athena.physics.lehigh.edu/">Dimitrios                Vavylonis</a> at Lehigh University and supported by <a  href="http://www.nigms.nih.gov/">NIH/NIGMS</a>)</p>            <p>Haosu Tang, Damien Laporte, Dimitrios Vavylonis, "Actin cable              distribution and dynamics arising from cross-linking, motor              pulling, and filament turnover", <em>Molecular Biology of the                Cell</em> (2014) <a  href="http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/25/19/3006.full.pdf">link</a>.              <br>              <br>              Tamara Bidone, Haosu Tang, Dimitrios Vavylonis, "Dynamic Network              Morphology and Tension Buildup in a 3D Model of Cytokinetic Ring              Assembly", <em>Biophysical Journal</em> (2014) <a  href="http://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495%2814%2901117-5.pdf">link</a>.            </p>            <p> Cells are well known as "building blocks" of life. The growth of              every living organism on earth relies on the proper growth and              division of cells. Malfunction of growth and division will cause              irregular cell morphorlogies, reproduction failures, cancers and              deaths. Actin, a ubiquitous kind of protein found in all cells, is              crucial for such polarized cell growth and division. Actin              monomers link to form actin filaments, which are then bundled by              crosslinking proteins to form actin cables. These cables serve as              tracks for the cell to transport organelles to where they belong,              establishing polarized growth. We started out from building a              coarse-grained 3D semiflexible polymer model that represents the              physical properties of actin filament. We further tested              persistence length, relaxation time, equipartition of energy of              this computational model. Effects of various actin interacting              proteins are then added to the system as potentials that affect              actin filaments structure and dynamics. Our model resembles the              actin cable features observed in experimental images extremely              well. Furthermore, it quantitatively explains actin cables              structures in multiple cell mutants and makes testable predictions              for future works. </p>            <p> <img  src="resource/simulation.gif"  alt="Simulation"  height="200px">            </p>            <p> The actin cable work has been presented at the following              conferences: <br>              1).

Actin dynamics in budding yeast</h3>            <p> Further, we modified the model and extended it to the budding              yeast systems. G2 growth phase budding yeast has a calabash shape              where the bud grow out of the mother at the budding site. Two              types of formins help polymerize actin filament at different              rates: one localized at the bud, the other at the neck. Our new              model adjusted to this complicated shape and polymerization              mechanism. </p>            <p> Preliminary snapshots:<br>            </p>            <p> <img  src="resource/buddingyeast.png"  alt="buddingyeast"  height="250px">            </p>            <!-- add-->            <p></p>            <p> The work is currently under preparation for publication. <br>              <br>              To appear in American Society of Cell Biology 2014 meeting at              Philadelphia. </p>            <br>            <h3> 3. Actin dynamics in droplet</h3>            <p> We are also interested in building a computational model to              simulate actin network structure and dynamics in confined space.              The simulation below shows actin proteins polymerize from random              positions and become bundled inside a droplet. The size of the              actin network becomes "squeezed" after bundling. Sometimes the              network can form a ring structure under certain conditions.<br>              <img  src="resource/droplet.gif"  alt="Droplet GIF"  height="400px">            </p>            <br>            <h3> 4. Worm-like chain and semiflexible polymers</h3>            <p>The single filament below is simulated as semi-flexible polymers.              The segment length is 0.1 &#956;m and the total filament length is 3              &#956;m. This filament fluctuates under thermal forces with its              persistence length set at 10 &#956;m. I compared the mechanical              properties (such as persistence length) of single filament and              bundle. The description for the filament model can be found in              supplementary material of my MBoC paper. This is a course project              I designed for BioE421 by Professor Anand Jagota.<br>              Project summary paper <a  href="resource/BioE421_TermPaper_HaosuTang.pdf"                 target="_blank">here</a>.<br>              <br>              This youtube video shows six filaments are initialized towards one              direction and fluctuate through the "zipping" process and finally              become bundled. Right panel is tangent correlation showing bundled              phase has a much larger persistence length. <br>              <img  src="resource/singlefilament.gif"  alt="Single filament GIF"                 height="315px">              <iframe  src="//www.youtube.com/embed/5JOW2FERhWY?rel=0"  allowfullscreen=""                 frameborder="0"                 height="315"                 width="420"></iframe>            </p>            <br>            <h3> 5. Lennard-Jones particles</h3>            <p>A system of particles is simulated here inside the box with              periodic boundary conditions under Lennard-Jones potential.              Velocities are rescaled under given temperature conditions. This              work is advised by Professor Jeetain Mittal as a final project for              CHE 498.<br>              <iframe  src="//www.youtube.com/embed/etyUl5xr9QI?rel=0"  allowfullscreen=""                 frameborder="0"                 height="315"                 width="560"></iframe>              <br>              Here a system of dumbbells is simulated showing symmetric motion              (constraint conditions). I used Lagrangian approach to include the              rigid body constraints of dumbbells. The constraint terms are              added to the bond potential. Positions are updated without              constraints using Position Verlet. An additional term is then              added to the position to count in the constraints.<br>              <iframe  src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QVNjinowSZc"  allowfullscreen=""                 frameborder="0"                 height="315"                 width="420"></iframe>            </p>            <br>            <h3> 6. Image registration and shape finding</h3>            <p> I developed a medical image processing application that performs              Gaussian smoothing, thresholding, shape finding and labeling on              medical images. This software can also reconstruct 3D images from              a stack of 2D images and track the movement of patterns.
