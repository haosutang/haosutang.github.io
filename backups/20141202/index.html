              <!--change time-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently a Ph.D.
              student in the department of Physics. I'm actively seeking
              experience opportunities in various fields of: Management/Business
              Consulting, Venture/Fund/Financial Services, Quantitative
              Analysis. I would even do interesting projects for free, simply
              for fun and self-improvement. </p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My major research field of interest is
              Biophysics. My current research work involves skills including:
              Physics, Mathematics (esp. PDE), Statistics, Cell biology,
              Computational simulation and modeling, Programming (Java, Matlab,
              Mathematica, C++) and Data Analysis.</p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My research projects are described in
              detail <a href="projects.html">here</a> with videos and figures.
              Projects:&nbsp;</p>
            <p>1.<em>Actin cable dynamics</em>: This is the main research topic
              towards my PhD thesis. Actin is a protein ubiquitous in living
              cells. Actin monomers can link to form actin filaments (F-actin).
              These actin filaments can be bundled together by cross-linking
              proteins to form actin cables. Here I developed a very
              comprehensive yet complicated 3D model which includes various
              protein mechanism to describe the dynamics of actin cables.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>2.<em>Actin dynamics in droplet</em>: Vast amount of research is
              focused upon the dynamics of actin <span style="font-style: italic;">in
                vitro</span>. Here I studied the actin dynamics in a confined
              droplet.</p>
            <p>3.<em>Worm-like chain (WLC) and Semiflexible polymers</em>: WLCs
              are found anywhere in our daily life. They can be as tiny as
              double-stranded DNA chain which is about 70nm in length (10<sup>-8</sup>m)
              to as large as polymeric materials that can span hundreds of
              meters (10<sup>3</sup>m). I developed a semiflexible polymer model
              that reflects the WLC behavior and simulated it in Java. I studied
              its mechanical properties and compared persistence lengths during
              the process of "zipping" and bundled phases. </p>
            <p>4.<em>Lennard-Jones particles</em>: I simulated a system of
              particles under Lennard-Jones potentials using both molecular
              dynamics and Monte Carlo algorithm. Constraint conditions were
              applied to simulate the Lennard-Jones dumbbell systems.</p>
            <p>5.<em>Image registration and shape finding</em>: 3D image
              structures can be generated from stacking 2D image slices. By
              applying a Gaussian filter and thresholding method it is possible
              to get rid of some background noise. Then I used region growing to
              find the shape of the image. I developed a specific shape find
              method that detects and marks the filamentous shape and was able
              to extract the skeleton of the shapes and find the mechanical
              properties accordingly.</p>
            <p>6.<em>Quantum information and computation</em>.</p>
            <p>7.<em>Remote Methane Leak Detector</em>.</p>
